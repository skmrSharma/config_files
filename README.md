* **Colorscheme**: Zenburn \([link](https://github.com/jnurmine/Zenburn)\)
### ZSH:
* GBT
* ufetch
### Markdown.pl
+ **Markdown.pl** is a script i use to convert md files to html.It requires the Perl v5.6 or later to work (Perl is usually installed by default on standard linux distros).
### Neovim
+ Plugins are listed in packer.lua.
+ Packer might fail installing the plugins when loading nvim for the first time, but it will work aferwords.
+ Some options are there for Neovide as well. It applies only if it's installed.
